# Gif

With GIF you can practice German or English with short stories. The stories are written in an easy language, and you can interact with the characters. You can give commands or write something appropriate to some other character in the story. Give your best to guide your characters through their adventure!     

The commands or things your characters say should also be written in a simple language. Examples are: 'Go right', 'Enter the house', 'What's in the basket' and so on. In case you don't know what you should write, you can find all possible commands in the Help page.   

In this version there is only one short story available: Little Red Riding Hood.

This Read Me is under construction 🙄😵‍💫😬
